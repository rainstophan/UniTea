1. Update(): The Update function is called once per frame, and it is typically used to update the position, rotation, and other properties of your game objects. This is the most commonly used update function, and it is a good place to put code that needs to run every frame.
2. FixedUpdate(): The FixedUpdate function is called at a fixed interval, and it is typically used to update physics-based properties such as forces and velocities. This function is useful for tasks that need to be performed at a consistent rate, regardless of the frame rate of the game.
3. LateUpdate(): The LateUpdate function is called after all other updates have been performed, and it is typically used to update camera and lighting systems. This function is useful for tasks that need to be performed after other objects have been updated, such as updating the position of a camera to follow a character.
4. OnGUI(): The OnGUI function is called every frame to draw the GUI (graphical user interface) elements in your game. This function is useful for tasks such as drawing health bars, score displays, and other types of HUD elements.
